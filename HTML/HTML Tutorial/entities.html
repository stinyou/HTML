            Some characters in HTML are reserved and must be replaced with entities.
            For example, must use &lt; for less than and &gt; for greater than symbols.
            This is especially useful when writing HTML elements like &lt;div&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are entity names and entity numbers in HTML.
            For less than, &lt; is the entity name and &#60; is the entity number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another useful entity is the non-breaking space.
            This allows text to remain together even if there is a new line that would separate them.
            For example, may want to use it on something like 20&nbsp;km/h.
            Can also, use non-breaking spaces to write multiple spaces in a row.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, can use &#8209; for a non-breaking hyphen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diacritical marks are "glyphs" added to letters, such as accents.
            Can combine these with alphanumeric characters to create characters that are not present it the usual set.
            For example, can write e&#769; and O&#771;.
