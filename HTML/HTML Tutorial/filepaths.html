            An absolute file path is the full URL to the file:<br>
            <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
        </p>
        <p>
            A relative file path is linked to the current page:<br>
            <img src="images/8 Kill Battle Box.png" alt="Minecraft">
        </p>
        <p>
            It is better practice to use relative file paths, as they cannot change
            without you knowing.
