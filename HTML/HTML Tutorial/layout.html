    <!--
    HTML has semantic elements that define parts of a page, which are:
    <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <details>, and <summary>

    There are four different methods of creating multicolumn pages, each with their own advantages and disadvantages:
    - CSS framework
    - CSS float property
    - CSS flexbox
    - CSS grid

    To create a layout quickly, one can use CSS frameworks like W3.CSS or Bootstrap
    For more on the other three methods, wait until CSS is covered in depth
